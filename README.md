# Introduction

This repo will contain all the progress made as I make my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) during my ARCH semester for RPI. It will include all projects that I have done, and anything else relevent to the course.

I will also be keeping a log of when and what I get done, which will be included in this README.
