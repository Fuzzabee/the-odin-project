# Introduction

This repo will contain all the progress made as I make my way through [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com/) during my ARCH semester for RPI. It will include all projects that I have done, and anything else relevent to the course.

This will be set up a bit differently from how TOP indicates, for ease of progress updates with RPI.
