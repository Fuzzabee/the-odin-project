        <!-- <a> are anchor elements which will link whatever is inside (text, images, etc) to another page, file, etc -->
        <!-- 'href' tag is a Hypertext REFerence -->
        <!-- 'target' tag specifies where the link opens. Default '_self' opens in current tab, '_blank' opens in new tab or window -->
        <!-- 'rel' with 'noopener' is paired with '_blank' as to prevent phishing attacks with a redirect -->
        <!-- 'rel' with 'noreferrer' prevents the opened link to know where the link originated -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>

        <!-- about.html is a relative link. It looks in the same directory as this current page, instead of having to type the absolute path -->
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

        <!-- 'img' displays the image located at 'src'. It is self closing, therefore no </img> tag -->
        <!-- 'alt' describes the image. It is used if the image won't load, as well as for accessibility features -->
        <!-- 'height' and 'width' should always be used, even with CSS, and even if it doesn't change the size of the image -->
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Picture of an awesome dog" width="320" height="426">
